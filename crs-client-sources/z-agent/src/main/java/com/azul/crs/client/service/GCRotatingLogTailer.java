/**
 * GC log rotation by JVM is done in a way unusable for external tailers to follow the changes:
 * A set of log files <logName>.<logNum> is used in a circle, additional marker suffix 'current'
 * is added to currently active log file.
 *
 * The class bellow implements heuristic tailing of GC log files starting from a log marked
 * as current. On each check the tailer reports new available bytes to a listener, and tries
 * to run after the latest current log file reporting to a listener everything on the way.
 * In the case of too frequent rotation with a very few log files the tailer won't be able
 * to report all the changes and will loose some of them. A slow reporting listener will lose
 * quickly changing log changes so well.
 *
 * Said above the feature is experimental, an appropriate listening to GC log records should
 * be done over more tight integration with JVM runtime.
